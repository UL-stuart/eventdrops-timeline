56,13/02/2026 10:02:39,tanya@localhost,online-boutique-7717,I see few load tests running on our platform CHG85387
57,13/02/2026 10:03:10,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,@tanya let's disable any load testing
58,13/02/2026 10:03:48,daniel@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Pausing all tests now
59,13/02/2026 10:04:00,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,let's disable both CHG85389 and CHG85389
60,13/02/2026 10:04:08,daniel@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Yes i have paused all tests - i still see the errors
61,13/02/2026 10:04:11,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,CHG85387 - ie
62,13/02/2026 10:04:36,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,@Christene - Lets try to ground and see what all we know till now .\n!. The login load has crossed 6k \n2. 1 suspect - Load test - its not\n3. How about external load ?
63,13/02/2026 10:04:52,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,Do the logs indicate any errors with a particular service or just failure to keep up with request load?
64,13/02/2026 10:04:55,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7717,:star: Facts over opinion
65,13/02/2026 10:05:04,shay@localhost,online-boutique-7717,We have paused all load tests  still the errors persists
66,13/02/2026 10:05:20,daniel@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Just failure to keep up load
67,13/02/2026 10:05:36,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,Can you confirm what the load is now vs historical average max load?
68,13/02/2026 10:05:39,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7717,:star: Asking questions to validate impact of the problem
69,13/02/2026 10:05:43,bob@localhost,online-boutique-7717,The sale was expected to bring just 10% more sales - the number we see is not normal
70,13/02/2026 10:06:03,PLAYER,business-comms-7717,It looks like the issue is related to added load on the system. Activey triaging now.
71,13/02/2026 10:06:11,tanya@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Historical avg load till date is 1.6k Logins per minutes right now its 6k
72,13/02/2026 10:06:33,daniel@localhost,online-boutique-7717,@Christene  Can we get the network distribution across regions data ?@Anyone
73,13/02/2026 10:07:15,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,I have validated all changes - This is not due to changes- The load is external
74,13/02/2026 10:07:31,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,great idea is the load being distributed across all available capacity?
75,13/02/2026 10:07:40,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,I was looking at Network traffic - But the dashboard took ages to load.
76,13/02/2026 10:07:44,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Here's a screenshot of Network traffic across each region.

80,13/02/2026 10:08:43,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,are we certain that this is not coming from a small set of IPs? @hamed
81,13/02/2026 10:09:13,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,This looks suspicious to me @Christene
82,13/02/2026 10:09:17,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,lets involve Sec ops
83,13/02/2026 10:09:19,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,@hamed what are our options to isolate or rate-limit incoming requests from spain
84,13/02/2026 10:09:31,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,@Maya
85,13/02/2026 10:09:32,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,@hamed yes please involve them
86,13/02/2026 10:09:35,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7717,:star: Escalating when required
87,13/02/2026 10:09:39,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Hey @cflounders-bloomberg.net after reviewing the logs I strongly suspect that this is a security-related issue.
88,13/02/2026 10:09:44,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7717,The abnormally high traffic with http 429 503 and 504 errors may be due to a possible DDoS/DoS attack
89,13/02/2026 10:09:50,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7717,I'll need to continue investigating further but it definitely looks like something is targeting our system
90,13/02/2026 10:09:55,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,@maya great thanks - can we please block the range of IPs we see this coming from
91,13/02/2026 10:09:55,tinus@localhost,business-comms-7717,Looks like we have a security threat - We should be extra careful with this incident
92,13/02/2026 10:10:00,bez@localhost,business-comms-7717,Do we know what's the financial impact of the issue? How much are we losing every minute?
93,13/02/2026 10:10:08,bez@localhost,business-comms-7717,@cflounders-bloomberg.net Should we inform the 'Compliance Team' about this issue?
94,13/02/2026 10:10:15,bez@localhost,business-comms-7717,The Compliance Team makes sure we follow laws and rules like reporting the incident to the right people and keeping proper records. It helps us avoid legal trouble and protects our reputation.
95,13/02/2026 10:10:16,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,@Christene  as you said looking at logs from dan - It is from single IP
96,13/02/2026 10:10:26,PLAYER,business-comms-7717,we believe this is due to DDoS we are actively looking to migitae

104,13/02/2026 10:11:34,tinus@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Can you confirm @cflounders-bloomberg.net?
105,13/02/2026 10:11:40,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7717,Lucky this was DoS (Denial of Service ) from a single IP - What if this attack happens from multiple IP addresses (DDoS)?
106,13/02/2026 10:11:43,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,Thanks can everyone look at logs/and see if still an issue

110,13/02/2026 10:11:52,bob@localhost,online-boutique-7717,@cflounders-bloomberg.net Should we let the customers know about the attack?
111,13/02/2026 10:12:15,tinus@localhost,business-comms-7717,Leave Compliance with me - I will talk to them
112,13/02/2026 10:12:27,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,@all please do not communicate anything we will need to make sure this communicated correctly due to regulatatory concerns
113,13/02/2026 10:12:44,PLAYER,online-boutique-7717,@all everyone it looks like this is currently fixed - can everyone confirm?
