23,16/02/2026 14:09,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,@bob How many customer reports are you getting?
24,16/02/2026 14:09,bob@localhost,online-boutique-7742,We're seeing over 1000 customer reports so far with the majority coming from the UK and USA but there are reports from other regions as well.
25,16/02/2026 14:09,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7742,:star: Asking questions to validate impact of the problem
26,16/02/2026 14:10,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,We have a few orders still coming through but not to match the user activity traffic spike
27,16/02/2026 14:10,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7742,:star: Qualify the problem
28,16/02/2026 14:10,bob@localhost,online-boutique-7742,That's correct—order volume is significantly lower than expected given the current traffic and many users are reporting issues completing purchases.
29,16/02/2026 14:10,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Do we have an incidnet ?
30,16/02/2026 14:10,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,I see there are lot of posts on social media
31,16/02/2026 14:10,PLAYER,business-comms-7742,An update on our end is that we're seeing some issues with the web application. Users are reporting problems accessing the site. It seems to be related to high spike in user traffic.
32,16/02/2026 14:10,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,I need specifics. How many users are affected and are we seeing any drop in completed orders or revenue? Also which regions are impacted?
33,16/02/2026 14:11,PLAYER,business-comms-7742,We're seeing over 1000 customer reports globally with the UK and USA most impacted. Orders per minute has dropped roughly 50%
34,16/02/2026 14:12,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7742,:star: Use metrics as evidence

36,16/02/2026 14:12,shay@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Im seeing a lot of errors in the logs
37,16/02/2026 14:12,shay@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Not sure what the root cause is but we are seeing high load on our Frontend Pods - this may be due to the ongoing discount or if it could be related to any tests we were running.
38,16/02/2026 14:12,shay@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I see high number of rest-call errors like  http429 http503 and 504s

52,16/02/2026 14:13,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,We can verify that before we attribute it to load/traffic spikes

55,16/02/2026 14:13,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I was looking at Network traffic - But the dashboard took ages to load.
56,16/02/2026 14:13,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Here's a screenshot of Network traffic across each region: !
57,16/02/2026 14:14,shay@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Wow Spain must really like our products.
58,16/02/2026 14:14,daniel@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I think the influencer we sponsored is based in Spain - That would explain the spike.
59,16/02/2026 14:14,tanya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Did some one misconfigered load test ?
60,16/02/2026 14:15,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,I'm going to open a P1 incident does anyone disagree with the severity?
61,16/02/2026 14:15,tanya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Yes please go ahead
62,16/02/2026 14:15,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I agree with the P1 severity given the scale of the traffic spike and global impact.
63,16/02/2026 14:15,PLAYER,business-comms-7742,
64,16/02/2026 14:15,uptimelabs@localhost,business-comms-7742,*Incident Number INC100018:* P1 Users cannot access the front end of the application leading to a reduction in traffic and sales
65,16/02/2026 14:15,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Understood. Confirm if we are currently losing revenue and provide the latest figures on lost sales. Keep me updated on progress and expected resolution time.
66,16/02/2026 14:15,uptimelabs@localhost,business-comms-7742,Yes we're currently losing revenue. Based on current trends estimated lost sales are around £20000 per hour. Engineering is investigating and I'll update you with an ETA as soon as possible.
67,16/02/2026 14:15,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,There is a stake holders meet in next 10 minutes
68,16/02/2026 14:16,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,Can someone look into the traffic from spain? See if all of it is legitimate? We could be being targeted for an intentional DoS attack
69,16/02/2026 14:16,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,The abnormally high traffic with http 429 503 and 504 errors may be due to a possible DoS attack.
70,16/02/2026 14:16,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7742,:star: Form a working theory
71,16/02/2026 14:16,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I'll need to continue investigating further but it definitely looks like something is targeting our system.
72,16/02/2026 14:17,tinus@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Looks like we have a security threat. Do we know what the financial impact is?
73,16/02/2026 14:17,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,Is there a way we can temporarily limit traffic in that spanish region?
74,16/02/2026 14:17,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Yes I can block or rate-limit traffic from specific IPs or regions immediately but I need a clear 'Go ahead' to proceed.
75,16/02/2026 14:17,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,I'll check with business leaders
76,16/02/2026 14:17,bob@localhost,online-boutique-7742,We're now exceeding 1800 complaints and have lost about $25000 in revenue so far.
77,16/02/2026 14:18,PLAYER,business-comms-7742,We can attempt to get the site operational before then. I'll update you closer to 14:25 if we can't meet that timeframe
78,16/02/2026 14:18,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Understood. Please keep me informed with any changes before 14:25. I expect immediate notification if the timeline slips or if the impact worsens.
79,16/02/2026 14:18,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Are we under an attack ?
80,16/02/2026 14:18,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Can you give me more details please
81,16/02/2026 14:18,PLAYER,business-comms-7742,Can I get the go ahead to limit traffic coming from our Spain region? We believe we are being DoS attacked it will theoretically improve stability across the rest of the globe
82,16/02/2026 14:18,uptimelabs@localhost,online-boutique-7742,:star: Formally assign criticality level to the incident
83,16/02/2026 14:19,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Will the customer data be lost ?
84,16/02/2026 14:19,PLAYER,business-comms-7742,It will just be user access in that region no data loss. So we can limit traffic coming from that region
85,16/02/2026 14:19,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,I am worried lets not disclose it to customer i want Complaince to handle clients
86,16/02/2026 14:19,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Go Ahead
87,16/02/2026 14:19,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Resolve it asap - you have my support
88,16/02/2026 14:20,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,I have permission from Bez that we can limit traffic coming from Spain Maya
89,16/02/2026 14:20,bez@localhost,business-comms-7742,Proceed with limiting Spain traffic if it will restore stability elsewhere. Monitor closely and report back on impact to order volume and revenue immediately after implementation.
90,16/02/2026 14:20,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Understood please confirm if you want me to block the malicious IP 149.34.52.176 now or apply a broader rate-limit to all Spanish traffic.
91,16/02/2026 14:20,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,Start small first go with that specific IP
92,16/02/2026 14:20,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,The IP address has now been blocked at the firewall.
93,16/02/2026 14:20,maya@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Traffic from that specific IP should be dropping to zero now.
94,16/02/2026 14:20,hamed@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Let's hope this was just a DoS from a single IP.
95,16/02/2026 14:20,tinus@localhost,online-boutique-7742,@PLAYER can you confirm everything is stabilizing?
96,16/02/2026 14:21,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,It looks that way give me a minute or so and I can confirm
97,16/02/2026 14:21,bob@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I can check the customer-facing metrics dashboard to see if error rates and complaints are dropping now.
98,16/02/2026 14:22,PLAYER,online-boutique-7742,Can we look into the front end changes to make sure that absolutely nothing from the latest release could have cause this?
99,16/02/2026 14:22,shay@localhost,online-boutique-7742,I just refreshed the site - it loaded instantly for me!
100,16/02/2026 14:22,daniel@localhost,online-boutique-7742,Logs are clearing up. The 429s and 503s have completely stopped.
